Session Controller
==================

Control sessions using PHP and MySQL.

### Getting started

I'm just getting this code loaded up on github. In future commits I will provide more usuage examples and documentation.

To experiment with the example. 

1. Create a MySQL database, execute the db.sql.
2. Update the config.php file with the correct database connection settings.
3. Navigate to the example directory and see what happens.
